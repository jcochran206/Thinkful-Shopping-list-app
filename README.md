# Thinkful-Shopping-list-app
## Description 
This app allows the user to create a personalized shopping list.  The user types his/her required item into the input field and will click the enter button to add it to the shopping list.  When the user clicks the check button it will strike or line thru the item to indicate it is complete.  The user can also delete an item by using the delete button.  The purpose of the exercise is to obtain familiarity with using an external library, manipulate the document, add event listeners, store data in an array, create usersâ€™ stories and pseudocode to help develop a well structure application to a minimum viable product (MVP).
